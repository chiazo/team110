## Key Objectives

- Mentor / Mentee Matching
- Checkins
- Shadowing

## My Guiding Principles

1. Each mentee should feel like they can approach at least one older member whenever they need help
1. One on one communication is way more effective then messages in the big slack channels
1. Mentors should also feel supported if any problems arise!

## Mentor / Mentee Matching

In order to make this work, I coordinated with the grad TA (Kaki) to get a list of new members, their year and the course they were TAing for (110 vs 211). I then reached out to exisiting TAs to find mentors, by messaging them on slack with an overview of what being a mentor would entail. Everyone who agreed was added to the Google Sheet.

- I used a Google Sheets document to match everyone (which ended up being my key reference point throughout the semester) with the help of Kris & Kaki
  - 211 TAs were matched with 211 TAs (same for 110 TAs)
- There were 2 slack channels that I communicated in (for general messages):
  - **#new-members**
  - **#mentors-f20**
- Otherwise, all other communication was done by DM. While a bit tedious, this made sure everyone felt directly spoken to and I could be sure of who received a message and who didn't. I felt this assurance was especially important in a completely remote semester. These types of messages were:
  - Introducing Mentee's to their Mentor (owness on the mentor to reach out separately)
  - Asking people to be Mentors

### Things to improve:

- I think it would be more equitable to create a form open to all TAs so people I might not have reached out to have a chance to express interest in being a mentor! This would have happened the first week of school.
- I also think it would have been good to touch base with Kris to see if there were specific desired pairings between new and old TAs before I began asking multiple people.

## Check Ins

- helping new members set up their profiles on github
- filling in when mentors can't
- every 2 weeks (aka once a month) messaging mentors to reach out to their mentees
- sending out a Google Form for feedback 3 months into the semester

A good example would be posting in random if anyone wanted to hop on my Zoom and work on the first problem set. Anticipating what may be difficult and providing an accessible stress free resource (a Zoom link) and a time helped a few people. I also, with the help of Naomi, set up a Zoom meeting for everyone to go over confusing parts of the code we had to finish before the semester began.

## Shadowing

This was a new addition to the semester with credit going to Claire for suggesting it! I would usually (on Sunday's) make a premptive list of TAs with office hours coinciding with a new member, using ShiftOverflow. I'd then message said older member to see if they'd be fine being shadowed. Once confirmed, I messaged the new member with the Date + Time + TA they'd be shadowing.

- Shadowing OH Techniques
- Shadowing Grading Techniques (for projects)

## Example Messages I Sent:

> helloooo! so we're looking for mentors for the 18 new team members. because things are virtual, this will be such a key way to build community. the theme for the semester is ~good vibes~ haha & i think you'd be spectacular at that :smile: just some expectations, this would involve being a resource & semi-regular check ins (for example: scheduling a 30 minute zoom chat every couple of weeks). Are you interested in being one? :slightly_smiling_face:
>
> hiii, if you have any questions about reapplying to be a TA, definitely reach out to your mentor or me! (also if you are returning to 110 & are interested in bumping up to 10 hours but don’t know what that entails, please please reach out, this was also super confusing for me too). :heart:
>
> if you have any questions about the new project, please message me or your mentor (we’d love to help) :heart: have a great rest of your week!
>
> ok, you’re all set to pair with **Mentor** for grading 211 stuff. You should message them and find 1 hour to grade together this coming week. You’ll be leading the grading you do together but definitely ask for any help (& check my message in #new-members for more info)

## Main Takeaways

- Running mentorship is all about filling in gaps. Some weeks, I'd just message each new member to make sure they were doing well and see if there's anything they needed. These convos varied from short to long and sometimes morphed into whole other topics.
- If you notice a new member is struggling with something, reach out! This can be anything from not knowing how to merge to the team repo or simply looking for a fellow TA in a difficult course. I dedicated some time to hoping on calls to work through these issues one on one if necessary or sending a message on behalf of a new member to facilitate a conversation between 2 people.
- A personal goal of mine was making sure people knew the value they added to the team. Encouraging new members to speak up during All Hands or getting them to contribute to documentation or other team projects is a good example. For the Mentor / Mentee Game Night, I tried to message every new member who left before the end and thank them for coming! It's my hope that all these new members one day feel comfortable bumping up to 10 hours and being leaders in their own right!

## Things I Helped Plan

- Mentor - Mentee Pairings
- Intro Zoom Calls to Troubleshoot the Problem Sets
- The Initial Mentor / Mentee Zoom Call
- Shadowing
- Google Form Feedback Form (1/2 way through semester)
- Mentor / Mentee Game Night

## Google Form Questions

1. Are you a mentor or a mentee?
1. How many times have you met with or spoken to your mentor/mentee?
1. Any feedback you have! (Have you felt supported, what have you enjoyed, what do you wish could be improved, any highlights, any issues, etc!)
1. Name (OPTIONAL)

### Main Takeaway from the form:

- Giving mentors more feedback about how they're doing through out the semester!
- Planning more mentor / mentee events!
