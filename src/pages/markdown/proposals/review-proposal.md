## Design Problem

Due to the new format of COMP110, where everything is online and quizzes will look more like timed programming exercises than paper exams, we need to invent what review sessions mean to better utilize the mediums we have available and better serve students in the course.

## Possible Directions

**Guided Practice** - A stronger emphasis is being placed on writing code for quizzes. These problems look much like exercises. Could we use some of the exercises we produce, or produce new ones specifically for reviewing, that pose the problem in a quiz-like manor and give students the opportunity to try while then also having a prerecorded or written-up tutorial walkthrough explaining a path toward a solution?

**Asynchronous Q&A** - Could we take up questions and have students vote on them during lecture or some period of time before answers are needed? Then, record response videos to the top ranked questions and add a page to the site that is organized by question and has direct responses to each question.

## Goals

1. Have some sort of review content (likely only time for async Q&A) ready by Sunday 9/6 for students to move through on their own time. We can ask for questions in Thursday's lecture.

2. Have a more stable plan in place for the weeks following.

## Review Sessions Tentative Workflow

**Main purpose:** Implement a four pronged approached that will:

1. Address specific student needs/questions before the quiz
2. Mimic the quiz environment by providing practice coding questions for the students to complete
3. Answer commonly asked questions
4. Improve with continual student feedback.

### **1. Google Form:**

- This will act as temperature gauge of where the students are at, what questions they still have, and which topics they would like practice with.
- It will be sent out at least a week before the quiz to ensure:
  1. Kush and I have time to design the review exercises
  2. Kush and I have time to film the answers to the coding exercises & write answers to commonly asked Q's
  3. The students have time to complete the review exercises and check their work

### **2. Practice exercises:**

- Based off the most commonly selected topics from the google form
- Around 2-3 practice coding questions, along with some simple questions (such as "how do you declare a variable")
- Written answer key for coding questions & simple questions
- Videos made on answers to coding questions (so students can hear how we thought about getting to the answer)

### **3. Commonly asked questions:**

- Based off the top asked questions by students from the google form
- Answered in written format FAQ style, perhaps uploaded onto the course page

### **4. Follow up survey:**

- Optional survey for students to give feedback on this process
